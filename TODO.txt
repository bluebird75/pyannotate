NOTES:
- understand why there is a mode to annotate with Any / Any
- provide scripts with shorter names and easier to use imports


TODO:
- fix tests related to stderr in pyannotate_tools/tests/dundermain_test.py 
- current fixer does not detect new style classes
- only Any is added at the start of the import statements
- fix mypy in strict mode
- add code coverage reporting
